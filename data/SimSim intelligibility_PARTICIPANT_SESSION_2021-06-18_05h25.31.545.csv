You will be asked to type what you heard the person say and rate how much effort it took to understand the speech. <br> While you do have the option to replay the utterance, please do not press replay unless there was some reason you could not hear the utterance (for example, if there was an unexpected loud noise outside). <br> Once the experiment has started, you will be asked not to further adjust your volume or your screen until it has finished.</p>","0"
