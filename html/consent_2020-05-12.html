            <font size="4">Key Information:</font>
          </u></i></b> The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether or not to be a part
          of this study. More detailed information is listed later on in this form.</p>
    <h4><i>Why am I being invited to take part in a research study?</i></h4>
    <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study because you meet inclusionary criteria for listener participants.</p>

    <h4><i>What should I know about a research study?</i></h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Someone will explain this research study to you.</li>
      <li>Whether or not you take part is up to you.</li>
      <li>You can choose not to take part.</li>
      <li>You can agree to take part and later change your mind.</li>
      <li>Your decision will not be held against you.</li>
      <li>You can ask all the questions you want before you decide.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><i>Why is this research being done?</i></h4>
    <p>This study investigates the kinds of differences that listeners perceive between different kinds of speech amplification devices.
      Speech amplification devices are often used as an augmentative form of communication for people with communication disorders, but
      more work is needed to be able to make better clinical recommendations and develop devices. We hope that this research will help
      to achieve these goals.</p>

    <h4><i>How long will the research last and what will I need to do?</i></h4>
    <p>
      Depending on the particular experiment, we expect that you will be in this research study for approximately 10 to 60 minutes over
      the course of one session.<br />
      You will be asked to listen to audio recordings of amplified speech samples. You will rate speech samples along a numerical scale
      or type what you heard.<br />
